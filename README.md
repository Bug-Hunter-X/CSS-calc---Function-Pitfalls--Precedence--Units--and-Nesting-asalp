# CSS calc() Function Pitfalls
This repository demonstrates some common errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected versions.  The issues highlighted include:

* **Missing Units:**  Forgetting to specify units (e.g., `px`, `%`, `em`) in `calc()` expressions.
* **Operator Precedence:** Incorrectly using parentheses to control the order of operations.
* **Nested Expressions:** Improper nesting of `calc()` expressions.

Understanding these issues is crucial for writing robust and reliable CSS.
