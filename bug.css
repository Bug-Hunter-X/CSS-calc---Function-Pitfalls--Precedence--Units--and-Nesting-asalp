The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because '10' lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions without proper parentheses: `height: calc(calc(50% - 10px) + 20px);` needs to be `height: calc((50% - 10px) + 20px);` to be correctly parsed.  Also, be cautious about mixing different units within a single `calc()` expression â€“ unexpected results can occur.
